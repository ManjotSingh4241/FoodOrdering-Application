🚀 Day 5 of developing my food ordering app 'Waves of Food' is complete! 🍔📱 Today, I added a history section to keep track of all your delicious orders, implemented a powerful search bar to easily find your favorite meals, updated the cart section for a smoother checkout experience, and finished designing the entire menu! Excited to share more progress soon. Stay tuned for the journey of this app from concept to launch! 🚀 #WavesOfFood #FoodAppDevelopment
