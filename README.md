🚀 Day 4 of Building My Food Ordering App! 🚀
The cart section is coming together nicely! 🛒 Now you can easily manage your orders with options to increase, decrease, or remove items from your cart. 🥳 It's been an exciting journey so far, bringing this app to life, one feature at a time! The UI is really starting to take shape, and I'm thrilled to see it all coming together. 🍔🍜 Next up, I'll be focusing on refining the checkout process and adding some final touches. Stay tuned for more updates! 🙌
